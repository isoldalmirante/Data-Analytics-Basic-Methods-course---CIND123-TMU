**Assignments completed for the Data Analytics Basic Methods course Winter 2023**

**Course Description**

This course is an introduction to R, analyzing and exploring data with R, and using R with a database. 
It focuses on statistics for model building and evaluation. Topics cover experimental research, correlation analysis, 
regression, confidence intervals, and group comparisons, and parametric and non-parametric models.

**Learn how to:**

- Utilize real datasets with graphs and numerical measures.
- Conduct a uni-variate and bi-variate analyses on datasets in R.
- Flag potential outliers for further investigation.
- Illustrate graphically the probability distribution of variables.
- Differentiate between discrete and continuous probability distributions.
- Calculate binomial probabilities using normal approximations.
- Investigate whether a sample size is large enough to apply the central limit theorem.
- Apply testing and estimation techniques for simple linear regression analyses in R.
