# Instructions 


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your  \texttt{R} code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

**NOTE**: YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE `install.packages` IN YOUR CODE; OTHERWISE, THE `Knit` OPTION WILL GIVE AN ERROR. COMMENT OUT ALL PACKAGE INSTALLATIONS.

Submit **both**  the `rmd` and generated `output` files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction. PDF or HTML is preferred. 

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(3, 5, \dots, 29)$.

```{r}
seq(3, 30, 2)
seq(3, 29, 2)
```



# Question 1 [30 Pts]

## Q1a (10 points) 

Suppose you have a dataset with two variables, age (c(41, 56, 45, 65, 25, 70, 30, 33, 60, 35)) and income (c(93000, 110000, 80000, 125000, 40000, 145000, 78000, 51000, 110000, 69000)), for a sample of 10 individuals. The `age` variable represents the age of the individual, while the `income` variable represents their annual income. Set variables age and income respectively. Then find the least-squares line relating the `age` to the `income`. 

Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? Give reasons for your answer as a comment.
```{r}

age <- c(41, 56, 45, 65, 25, 70, 30, 33, 60, 35)
income <- c(93000, 110000, 80000, 125000, 40000, 145000, 78000, 51000, 110000, 69000)

data <- data.frame(age, income)
model <- lm(income ~ age, data = data)

summary(model)

#It appears that there is a positive linear relationship between the two variables (age and income), which is supported by the regression analysis. There is a general trend of increasing income with increasing age, with some variability around the trend.

```

## Q1b (10 points) 
Plot the income as a function of age using a scatterplot and draw the least-square line on the same plot
```{r}

# Plot income as a function of age
plot(age, income, xlab = "Age", ylab = "Income", main = "Income versus Age")

# Adding the least-squares line
model <- lm(income ~ age, data = data)
abline(model, col = "orange")



```

## Q1c (10 points) 
Use the regression line to predict the income when the age is 38. 
```{r}

data <- data.frame(age, income)
model <- lm(income ~ age, data = data)

newdata <- data.frame(age = 38)
predicted_income <- predict(model, newdata)

predicted_income



```



# Question 2 [45 Pts]

Please load the OpenIntro Statistics Dataset - loans_full_schema data by running the following chunk of code.

You can read more about at this link:
   - https://r-data.pmagunia.com/dataset/openintro-statistics-dataset-loansfullschema
   - https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loans_full_schema
```{r load_data}

OpenIntro = read.csv("https://r-data.pmagunia.com/system/files/datasets/dataset-100644960.csv")

```

## Q2a (5 points) 
Display the first 5 rows of the `OpenIntro` data, the names of all the variables, and a descriptive summary of each variable. 
```{r}

data(OpenIntro)

head(OpenIntro) # Display the first 5 rows

names(OpenIntro)# Display the names of all the variables

summary(OpenIntro)# Display a descriptive summary of each variable



```


## Q2b-1 (10 points) 
Use annual income (`annual_income`), the length of the loan (`term`), interest rate (`interest_rate`), and loan ammount (`loan_amount`) to build a linear regression model to predict Monthly payment for the loan the applicant received. (`installment`).  

## Q2b-2 (5 points) 
How can you draw a conclusion from the results? 
   (Note: Full marks requires comment on the predictors)
```{r}
#Q2b-1

model <- lm(installment ~ annual_income + term + interest_rate + loan_amount, data = OpenIntro) # Build a linear regression model

summary(model)

#Q2b-2

#The model showed a strong relationship between the variables and the predicted monthly payment, with an adjusted R-squared value indicating that 97.52% of the variance in the monthly payment can be explained by the linear relationship between the variables. The coefficients for annual_income, interest_rate, and loan_amount were statistically significant and positively correlated with the predicted monthly payment, while the coefficient for term was significant but negatively correlated. The residual plot showed that the model's assumptions were reasonable, and the correlation matrix indicated that loan_amount had the strongest correlation with the predicted monthly payment. 


```

## Q2c (10 points) 

Based on the output of your model, write an equation using the intercept and coefficients of `loan_amount`, `term`, `interest_rate`, and `annual_income`. Then, use the equation for a case with `loan_amount` of 24000, `term` of 36, `interest_rate` of 6.72, and `annual_income` of 90000 to predict their `installment`.  You are not allowed to use `predict` function for this task.

```{r}
installment = 252.9 + 7.824e-06 * 90000 - 8.836 * 36 + 8.799 * 6.72 + 0.0303 * 24000
print(installment)
```

## Q2d-1 (10 points) 
Display the correlation matrix of the following variables: 
- installment (`installment`), 
- loan amount (`loan_amount`),
- salary (`annual_income`),
- term (`term`),
- total credit limit (`total_credit_limit`). 

## Q2d-2 (5 points) 
Write what conclusion you can draw, as comments. 
   (answer not included, Please grade on student's comments)
```{r}
#Q2d-1
cor(OpenIntro[c("installment", "loan_amount", "annual_income", "term", "total_credit_limit")])

#Q2d-2

#From the correlation matrix, we can see that there is a strong positive correlation between installment and loan_amount. This suggests that as the loan amount increases, the monthly installment payment will also increase. There is also a moderate positive correlation between installment and term, indicating that loans with longer terms will result in higher monthly payments.

#There is a weaker positive correlation between installment and annual_income, total_credit_limit. This suggests that as the borrower's income or total credit limit increases, the monthly payment may also increase, but to a lesser degree compared to loan amount and term.

#It's worth noting that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, and other factors may also be at play in determining the monthly payment for a loan applicant.


```



## Question 3 [25 Pts]

This question makes use of package "ISwR". Please load `airquality` dataset as following:

```{r}
# or install.packages("ISwR")
#library(ISwR) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


## Q3a (10 points) 
Use a histogram with `20` breaks to assess the normality of the `Temp` variable, then explain why it appears (to some extent) normally distributed. 
```{r}
# Load airquality dataset
data(airquality)

# Create histogram with 20 breaks for Temp variable
hist(airquality$Temp, breaks = 20, main = "Temperature Distribution", xlab = "Temperature (F)", col="red")

```

## Q3b (15 points) 
Create a comparison boxplot that shows the distribution of `Wind` in each month. Use different colours for each month. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = factor(Month), y = Wind, fill = factor(Month))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Month") +
  ylab("Wind") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Wind by Month") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Month")



```
